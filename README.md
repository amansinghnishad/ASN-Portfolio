**Objective:**
The objective of creating my own portfolio website was twofold. 
Firstly, it provided me with an opportunity to showcase my skills, projects, and experiences in a professional manner. 
Secondly, it served as a learning experience to delve into the world of Bootstrap and understand its integration with HTML and CSS.

**Content:**
As I embarked on this project, my primary focus was on exploring the functionalities of Bootstrap and seamlessly integrating it with my HTML and CSS code.
This project marked a significant step forward from my previous endeavors, as I delved into new technologies and aimed to create something unique.

Throughout the development process, I acquired several key learnings that have shaped my understanding of web development:

**1. Responsive Design with Bootstrap**: Integrating Bootstrap allowed me to create a responsive website that adapts effortlessly to various screen sizes. 
   By leveraging Bootstrap's grid system and pre-designed components, I was able to optimize the user experience across devices.

**2. Utilizing Bootstrap Classes:** I discovered that memorizing every Bootstrap class is not essential Instead, understanding the keywords and the
   purpose behind each class empowers me to modify and customize the styles effectively.

**3. Understanding Bootstrap Functionality:** To fully harness the power of Bootstrap, I delved into the underlying code structure. This comprehension
   enabled me to identify specific lines of code responsible for desired functionalities, empowering me to modify and extend the Bootstrap framework to suit
   my project's requirements.

**4. Focus on Learning:** Instead of just memorizing code snippets, I realized the importance of truly understanding how things work. By focusing on learning the underlying principles of Bootstrap, I was able to apply them creatively and adaptively to build unique website components. It's about gaining knowledge and grasping the concepts behind the code rather than just memorizing it.

**New Features to be Added:**
Moving forward, I have several exciting features planned to enhance my portfolio website:

**1. Contact Form:** Adding a contact form will provide visitors with an easy and convenient way to get in touch with me, enabling effective communication.

**2. New Blogs:** Regularly updating the website with new blog posts will demonstrate my knowledge, insights, and thought leadership
   in relevant areas, fostering engagement with visitors.

**3. New Projects:** Showcasing additional projects that I undertake will highlight my continued growth as a developer and demonstrate my ability to tackle
   diverse challenges.

These new features are just the beginning, as I am continuously exploring and incorporating new ideas to enhance my portfolio website.
By undertaking this project, I am not only creating an impressive online presence but also solidifying my skills and pushing the boundaries
of my web development capabilities.
